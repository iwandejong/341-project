Here's a pseudocode representation of your `Parser` class, which provides an overview of its structure and logic:

### Pseudocode for the Parser Class

#### Parser Class
- **Variables:**
  - `rules`: List of production rules for the grammar.
  - `syntaxTree`: The syntax tree to be built during parsing.
  - `tokenList`: List of tokens from the lexer.

#### Constructor
- `Parser(_rules, _tokens)`: Initializes `rules` and `tokenList`.

### Parse Method
- **Initial Setup:**
  - Create a stack `ruleStack` and push the start symbol (`$`) and the first rule.
  - Initialize a token iterator `atToken` pointing to the current token.
  - Create the root node of the syntax tree and push it onto a `nodeStack`.

- **Call** `parseHelper` with initial parameters.

#### Parse Helper Method (Recursive)
- **Base Cases:**
  - If `ruleStack` only contains the start symbol, parsing is complete.
  - If `nodeStack` is empty, throw an exception.

- **Symbol Expansion:**
  - If the current symbol is a terminal:
    - If the token matches, add it to the syntax tree and move to the next token.
    - If no match is found and remaining rules exist, throw a syntax error.
  - If the current symbol is a non-terminal:
    - Expand it into possible rules using `findFIRST`.
    - If epsilon transition is possible, continue with the next symbol.
    - Otherwise, recursively expand further rules.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Check for epsilon transitions and manage the rule stack accordingly.
  - If the stack is empty, throw an exception indicating a syntax error.

### Supporting Methods
- **findProductionRule(identifier):** Finds the production rule that matches the given identifier.

- **findFIRST(symbol, identifier):**
  - Builds a list of possible rules for a non-terminal based on the current token.
  - Returns the list of rules if found, or handles epsilon transitions.

- **findRuleIndex(rule, symbol):**
  - Locates the index of a specific symbol within the right-hand side of a rule.

### Explanation of Key Concepts

- **Token Matching:** The parser checks if the current token matches the expected symbol using regex patterns or direct string comparisons.
- **Epsilon Transition:** Handles cases where a non-terminal symbol can transition to an empty production (`Îµ`).
- **Syntax Tree Construction:** Nodes are added to the syntax tree based on matching tokens or expanded rules.

This pseudocode summarizes the logic of the parser, making it easier to understand its flow and purpose.
