Develop a compiler for the RecSPL (Recursive Students' Programming Language). The language eliminates traditional looping constructs (like WHILE ), requiring that all iterations be achieved through recursion. The project will culminate in a fully functional compiler that can parse, analyze, and run RecSPL programs.
